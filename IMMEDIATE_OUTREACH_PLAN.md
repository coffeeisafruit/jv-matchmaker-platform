# Immediate Outreach Plan - Soulful Leadership Retreat Attendees

## PRIORITY 1: Danny Bermant - "Captain JV" (Contact TODAY)

**Why He's Critical:**
- Company: CaptainJV = Joint Venture specialist
- He advises Christina Hills (your client mentioned in CSV: "Danny Bermant's client")
- Attending same retreat as 5 of your contacts
- Has Calendly link = easy to book meeting
- His entire business = JV partnerships (your exact service area)

**Contact Info (From Supabase):**
- Email: danny@captainjv.co
- Calendly: https://calendly.com/captainjv/catch-up-call
- Retreat Dates: Feb 4-8, looking for 1 villa roommate

**Outreach Strategy:**

### Option 1: Email + Book Calendly (Recommended)

**Email Subject:** Christina Hills Connection + Captain JV Partnership

**Email Body:**

Hi Danny,

Christina Hills mentioned you're her advisor - and I noticed we're both connected to the Soulful Leadership Retreat community!

I help transformation leaders find strategic JV partnerships through AI-powered matching. Given your "Captain JV" expertise, I see a powerful potential collaboration:

**What We Do:**
- AI-powered matching of JV partners (3,581 profiles in database)
- Serve coaches, speakers, retreat leaders seeking partnerships
- Several clients attending Feb 4-8 retreat (Joe Apfelbaum, Antonia Van Becker, Whitney Gee, John Beach, Linda Beach)

**Why This Could Be Valuable:**
1. You advise on JV strategy → We provide matched partners
2. Your expertise + our matching = comprehensive JV solution
3. Retreat attendees need both strategy AND matches

I'd love to explore:
- Partnership to serve retreat attendees together
- How we can support Christina's JV needs
- Potential collaboration on future JV matching

I'm going to book a time on your Calendly - or would you prefer to connect at the retreat itself?

Looking forward to connecting!

P.S. Joe Apfelbaum (who hosted Partner Palooza) is also attending and speaks highly of the retreat's JV focus.

Hi Susan,
