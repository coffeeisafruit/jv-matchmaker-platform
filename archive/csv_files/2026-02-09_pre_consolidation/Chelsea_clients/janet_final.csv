Hi David,

I've been following SelfGrowth.com and love how you help entrepreneurs and business owners build and scale their businesses.

Here's what I've noticed: Your entrepreneurs and business owners are successful at what they do... but many feel something's missing. They've achieved results but haven't clarified their true PURPOSE.

That's where I come in. I'm Janet Attwood, co-creator of The Passion Test—a simple but powerful process used by hundreds of thousands of people in 65+ countries to discover what matters most to them.

You help them succeed. I help them discover WHY.

When someone knows their passions, everything you teach them becomes more powerful. They're more motivated, more focused, and more likely to follow through.

I'd love to explore how we might support each other's audiences. A few ideas:

  • I could be a guest on your podcast/webinar sharing the 3-question Passion Test framework
  • We could cross-promote to our respective communities
  • You could offer Passion Test certification to your clients as a complementary tool
  • We could co-create a resource for your audience

Would you be open to a quick call to explore possibilities?

With passion,
Janet Bray Attwood

Hi Lori,

I've been following Reimagine U Strategies and love how you help entrepreneurs and business owners build and scale their businesses.

Here's what I've noticed: Your entrepreneurs and business owners are successful at what they do... but many feel something's missing. They've achieved results but haven't clarified their true PURPOSE.

That's where I come in. I'm Janet Attwood, co-creator of The Passion Test—a simple but powerful process used by hundreds of thousands of people in 65+ countries to discover what matters most to them.

You help them succeed. I help them discover WHY.

When someone knows their passions, everything you teach them becomes more powerful. They're more motivated, more focused, and more likely to follow through.

I'd love to explore how we might support each other's audiences. A few ideas:

  • I could be a guest on your podcast/webinar sharing the 3-question Passion Test framework
  • We could cross-promote to our respective communities
  • You could offer Passion Test certification to your clients as a complementary tool
  • We could co-create a resource for your audience

Would you be open to a quick call to explore possibilities?

With passion,
Janet Bray Attwood

Hi Alan,

I've been following Human Pattern Recognition and love how you help entrepreneurs and business owners build and scale their businesses.

Here's what I've noticed: Your entrepreneurs and business owners are successful at what they do... but many feel something's missing. They've achieved results but haven't clarified their true PURPOSE.

That's where I come in. I'm Janet Attwood, co-creator of The Passion Test—a simple but powerful process used by hundreds of thousands of people in 65+ countries to discover what matters most to them.

You help them succeed. I help them discover WHY.

When someone knows their passions, everything you teach them becomes more powerful. They're more motivated, more focused, and more likely to follow through.

I'd love to explore how we might support each other's audiences. A few ideas:

  • I could be a guest on your podcast/webinar sharing the 3-question Passion Test framework
  • We could cross-promote to our respective communities
  • You could offer Passion Test certification to your clients as a complementary tool
  • We could co-create a resource for your audience

Would you be open to a quick call to explore possibilities?

With passion,

I've been following Ecstatic Way and love how you help entrepreneurs and business owners build and scale their businesses.

Here's what I've noticed: Your entrepreneurs and business owners are successful at what they do... but many feel something's missing. They've achieved results but haven't clarified their true PURPOSE.

That's where I come in. I'm Janet Attwood, co-creator of The Passion Test—a simple but powerful process used by hundreds of thousands of people in 65+ countries to discover what matters most to them.

You help them succeed. I help them discover WHY.

When someone knows their passions, everything you teach them becomes more powerful. They're more motivated, more focused, and more likely to follow through.

I'd love to explore how we might support each other's audiences. A few ideas:

  • I could be a guest on your podcast/webinar sharing the 3-question Passion Test framework
  • We could cross-promote to our respective communities
  • You could offer Passion Test certification to your clients as a complementary tool
  • We could co-create a resource for your audience

Would you be open to a quick call to explore possibilities?

With passion,
