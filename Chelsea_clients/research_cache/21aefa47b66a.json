And most importantly, I believe that our dream project will make us fall in love with what we do and impact our community.",
  "social_proof": "I have been able to have success in 3 very different industries: business, music, and spirituality. I earned my CMA accounting certification while doing a 40 hr course load in 1st year of my Honours in Music degree. I have had many chances to conduct choirs live, including a segment of an opera. I am now working with a coaching industry leader and mentor, Eben Pagan. I have the resources and knowledge to write a personality profiling book based on tarot cards and their application in career advancement and team building. I have been earning money to invest in myself, such as a 6K 1-on-1 VIP service with Maria Stamos, the 30K speaker training program with Jase Souder.",
