  "Notes": "Company formerly 'Infinite Lists' \u2014 rebranding. Doing a launch, looking for partners \u2014 potential fit. At dinner with Mark. He and his partner (female) have an 'I know everybody' attitude. She was more closed off; he was more open \u2014 'I don't need you, but willing to invest to see if there's something.' Nice guy. He handles large-scale operations.",
