# AI-Powered Speaker & Podcast Booking: Expansion Opportunity

**Date:** January 2025
**Status:** Discussion Draft

---

## Background

Someone on JVD raised the topic of booking speakers onto events as a done-for-you (DFY) service. This sparked a question:

> **Could AI be leveraged for speaker booking and podcast booking?**

**Short answer: Yes.** Our existing JV Matchmaker platform already does 80% of what's needed—it's the same "match + pitch + pipeline" motion we're building for JV partnerships.

## How AI Fits Into Speaker/Podcast Booking

### What AI Handles Well

| Capability | How It Applies |
|------------|----------------|
| **Prospecting/Research** | Scraping and analyzing podcasts/events to find good fits based on topic alignment, audience size, format, guest history |
| **Personalized Pitch Generation** | Our PVP engine already does this—crafting outreach that references specific episodes and explains value prop |
| **Match Scoring** | Rating podcast/event fit based on speaker's expertise, target audience, past appearances |
| **Follow-up Sequences** | Automated but personalized follow-ups using GEX methodology |

### What Still Needs Human Touch

- Relationship nurturing (hosts often book people they know/trust)
- Calendar coordination and logistics
- Negotiation on fees/terms
- Quality control on which opportunities are worth pursuing

---

## Market Opportunity

DFY speaker and podcast booking agencies currently charge **$1,500–$5,000+/month**.

If we can automate 70–80% of the research and outreach work, we'd have a similar margin profile to our matching platform.

## What We'd Need to Build

To add speaker/podcast booking as a vertical:

1. **Database of podcasts/events** — Could use Clay or Exa to build and enrich
2. **Adapted match scoring** — Speaker-to-show fit instead of JV partner fit
3. **Modified PVP generator** — Booking pitch templates vs. JV pitch templates
4. **Same pipeline tracking** — Already building this for v1.5

---

## Options to Discuss

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Add as a vertical to JV Matchmaker** | Leverage existing infrastructure, same customer base | Dilutes focus, requires new database |
| **White-label to existing booking agencies** | B2B revenue, agencies handle fulfillment | Less control, lower margins |
| **Partner with JVD contact** | Shared resources, domain expertise | Split economics, coordination overhead |

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Sync as a team to discuss strategic fit
2. Identify which Tier 1 use cases align best with current roadmap
3. Explore conversation with JVD contact to understand their current process
