## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Current codebase (v1.0)**: Fully functional, no changes needed until you're ready
- **Integration approach**: Non-breaking, phased rollout
- **Timeline**: 11 phases, ~13 weeks estimated
- **Risk level**: Low (new features added alongside, existing code untouched initially)

## 🚀 When You're Ready

1. Review all documents in `/docs/`
2. Confirm you want to proceed with integration
3. Start with Phase 1 (Foundation)
4. Follow the roadmap step-by-step

## 📞 Questions?

All research, analysis, and planning documents are in `/docs/`. Review them when ready to begin implementation.
