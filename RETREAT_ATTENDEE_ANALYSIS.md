## Email Templates

### Template 1: Danny Bermant (Captain JV)

**Subject:** Captain JV - Mutual Connection via Christina Hills

Hi Danny,

Christina Hills mentioned you're her advisor - and I noticed we're both attending the Soulful Leadership Retreat Feb 4-8!

I help transformation leaders find strategic JV partnerships through AI-powered matching. Given your "Captain JV" expertise, I'd love to:

1. Learn about your JV methodology
2. Explore potential collaboration
3. Connect you with some retreat attendees who might be good JV partners

Christina is one of our clients and attended Partner Palooza Round 4 with Joe Apfelbaum. I think there's strong synergy between what you do and what we offer.

Would you be open to a quick call before the retreat, or coffee there?

Looking forward to meeting you!

[Your name]

### Template 2: Michelle Abraham (Amplify You)

**Subject:** Amplify You + JV Matching = Strategic Partnership?

Hi Michelle,

I saw you're attending the Soulful Leadership Retreat Feb 4-8! Several of our clients will be there too (Joe Apfelbaum, Antonia Van Becker, Whitney Gee, John Beach, Linda Beach).

I help transformation leaders find strategic JV partnerships through AI-powered matching. Based on your "Amplify You" company name, I'm guessing you help people amplify their reach - potentially through podcasts or media?

If so, there might be strong synergy:
- We match partners
- You amplify their reach together

Would you like to connect at the retreat? Happy to introduce you to attendees who'd be great podcast guests or JV partners.

[Your name]
