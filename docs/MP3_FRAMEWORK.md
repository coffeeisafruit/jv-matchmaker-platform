# MP3 Launch Framework

Erica Schneider's methodology for strategic launch content that converts.

## The Problem

Most launches fail because creators:
- Wing their content strategy
- Post randomly without a plan
- Focus only on the product, not the audience journey
- Miss critical psychological moments

## The Solution: MP3 Framework

Market the **Problem**, **Process**, and **Proof** across three phases:

```
PRE-LAUNCH          LAUNCH              POST-LAUNCH
+-------------+     +-------------+     +-------------+
| Problem     |     | Announcement|     | Buyers      |
| Process     | --> | Nurture     | --> | Non-Buyers  |
| Proof       |     | Urgency     |     |             |
+-------------+     +-------------+     +-------------+
    Build              Convert            Nurture
    Anticipation       Interest           Relationships
```

## Phase 1: Pre-Launch (Problem → Process → Proof)

### Goal
Build anticipation by systematically addressing:
1. The problem your audience faces
2. The process/solution you've developed
3. The proof that it works

### Key Activities
- Spotlight the pain (make them feel seen)
- Expose myths and misconceptions
- Share behind-the-scenes of your solution
- Offer quick wins and teaser content
- Build social proof through stories

### Duration
- Small launch: 2 weeks
- Standard launch: 4-6 weeks
- Mega launch: 60-90 days

## Phase 2: Launch (Announcement → Nurture → Urgency)

### Announcement (Days 1-2)
- Doors are open!
- Full product reveal
- Early bird bonuses

### Nurture (Middle of launch)
- Detail the transformation
- Share early feedback/wins
- Address objections and FAQs
- Reveal bonuses
- Build social proof

### Urgency/Cart Close (Final 2-3 days)
- Last chance messaging
- Final testimonials
- Countdown pressure
- Risk reversal (guarantees)

## Phase 3: Post-Launch

### Buyers
- Welcome and onboarding
- Check-in for support
- Advanced tips for value
- Request wins/testimonials
- Upsell/cross-sell opportunities

### Non-Buyers
- Feedback request (why didn't they buy?)
- Graceful acknowledgment
- Gratitude and future nurturing

## The AHA Moment Formula

The key to effective launch content:

```
Give clarity on WHAT to do and WHY
           |
           v
    Offer is the HOW (shortcut)
```

Every piece of content should deliver an insight that makes the audience think:
- "Now I understand what I need to do"
- "Now I understand why this matters"
- "I want the shortcut to actually do it"

## Content Distribution

### Email Frequency

| Phase | Frequency | Goal |
|-------|-----------|------|
| Pre-Launch | 2-3x/week | Become constant presence |
| Launch | 2-5 emails total | Convert interest |
| Post-Launch | 3-5 (buyers), 2-3 (non-buyers) | Nurture relationships |

### Channels

The 54-play library works across:
- Email (primary)
- Social media (adapted)
- Webinars/live events
- Blog posts
- Podcast episodes

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

Based on Erica Schneider's style:

- **Conversational** - Like talking to a friend
- **Parentheticals** - Asides for personality: "(can you feel the sarcasm?)"
- **Varied sentence length** - Long → Short → Punchy
- **Strategic emphasis** - Bold/italic for key points
- **Sparse emojis** - Used strategically, not constantly
- **Self-deprecating humor** - Balanced with expertise
- **Sign-off** - "Cheers"
- **P.S.** - Always includes value (tease, link, or clarification)

## Email Structure Templates

### Pre-Launch Story Email
```
{Engaging Opening: Commanding action statement}

Before we dive in today, I've got a quick announcement.

{Personal anecdote from childhood/past - 2-3 paragraphs}

But when I {entered new phase}, I {sacrificed authentic voice}.

I was fine with it because {initial positive outcome}.

This continued until {catalyst for change}...

{Detailed framework or steps - numbered list}

This only scratches the surface, but it's a good start.

PS: {Soft tease of upcoming offer}
```

### Launch Day Email
```
{Excited announcement}!

The time has come...

For you to {main benefit}...

And in under {timeframe}...

Get {specific outcome}

{Product Name} is a step-by-step system to {main function}.

What's inside {Product Name}:
- {Feature 1 with benefit}
- {Feature 2 with benefit}
- {Feature 3 with benefit}

{CTA Button}

Cheers,
{Name}

PS: {Personal note or urgency}
```

### Cart Close Email
```
{Time remaining}: Last call for the sale

In a few short hours, doors close on {Product} sale.

Thanks for sticking with me the past {X} days.

So, for the last time, here's what's inside:
- {Feature 1}
- {Feature 2}
- {Feature 3}

{CTA with urgency}

PS: After tonight, {what happens next}
```

## Integration with Launch Content Engine

The MP3 Framework provides the strategic structure:
- **54-Play Library** = Tactical execution
- **MP3 Phases** = Strategic timing
- **AHA Formula** = Content quality bar

Each generated play maps to an MP3 category:
- Problem plays (1-9)
- Process plays (10-23, 24-46)
- Proof plays (11, 27, 29-30, 37, 41)
