# Publisher Target List for Audiobook Production Services
## B2B Audiobook Services Business Development
### Compiled February 2026

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Goal:** Identify publishers who do NOT currently offer audiobooks as a service, to pitch audiobook production partnership services.

**Market Opportunity:**
- Global audiobook market: $5.3 billion (2024)
- Projected market: $35 billion by 2030
- Growth rate: 26.4% annually
- By 2030: Audio titles will account for 21.3% of global book publishing revenue

**Key Insight:** Most small and independent publishers do NOT have in-house audiobook capabilities. They rely on:
1. Authors retaining audio rights and self-producing
2. Third-party production partnerships (YOUR OPPORTUNITY)
3. Simply not offering audio at all

# METHODOLOGY: HOW TO VERIFY IF A PUBLISHER HAS AUDIOBOOKS

## Step 1: Check Audible Listings
- Go to Audible.com
- Search for 3-5 titles from the publisher
- Look at the audio publisher credit (below book summary)
- Format: "©2020 [Print Publisher] (P)2020 [Audio Publisher]"

**If the audio publisher is different from print publisher = NO in-house audio program**
**If no audio version exists = PRIME TARGET**

## Step 2: Check Publisher Website
- Look for "audiobooks" or "audio" in their catalog
- Check submission guidelines for "audio rights" language
- If they say "we don't acquire audio rights" = PRIME TARGET

## Step 3: Cross-Reference ACX
- Check if titles appear on ACX (Audiobook Creation Exchange)
- If authors are producing their own audio = publisher has no program
